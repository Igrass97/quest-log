Began working with the Django Getting Started Documentation but instead of doing a Polls App, I'll build a very barebones Blog Application, just to get started.

- Bootstraped Django Project and Django App (blog).
- Added an example view to the blog app.
- Added `urls.py` (linking the example view) to the blog app and imported the URL's in the main project's application (igblog).
- Created Post, Comment and Like models. Migrations created and ran.
- Learnt a little bit of relations between models (OneToMany, ManyToMany), need to revisit the subject.
